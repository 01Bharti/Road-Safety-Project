# Preprocessed Data 
Preparing data for visualization involves several key steps: cleaning the data to eliminate irrelevant or missing information, transforming it into a visualization-friendly format, exploring the data to uncover patterns and trends, filtering it to concentrate on specific subsets, and ensuring it is accurate and complete for use with visualization software. These steps collectively help make the data more comprehensible and ready for creating insightful visualizations.The data is preprocessed using Qlik platform. Various functions are directly available on the platform that can be directly applied to platform.

# Visualizations
To prepare data for visualization, one must clean the data by removing irrelevant or missing entries, transform it into a format suitable for visualization, explore it to identify patterns and trends, filter it to focus on specific subsets, and prepare it for use with visualization software. Ensuring the data's accuracy and completeness is crucial. This process helps make the data easily understandable and ready for creating visualizations to gain insights.
# Number of Unique Visualizations 
A dataset allows for various visualizations like bar charts, line charts, heat maps, scatter plots, pie charts, and maps to compare, track changes, show distributions, relationships, and category breakdowns.

# Dashboard
A dashboard is a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to display information and data inan organized, easy-to-read format. These tools are commonly used for real-time monitoringand data analysis, tailored to specific purposes or use cases.In Qlik, a dashboard refers to a collection of visualizations, data, and analytics that providesa comprehensive view of key metrics and insights. Qlik, a leading platform in data analyticsand business intelligence, enables users to create interactive dashboards for real-time dataexploration and informed decision-making.
# Storytelling
Storytelling in a Qlik project involves crafting a narrative around the insights and findings
derived from data analysis using Qlik Sense. This approach focuses on presenting data
compellingly and informatively, engaging stakeholders and effectively communicating key
insights.
